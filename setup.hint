ldesc: "nomarch lists/extracts/tests '.arc' archives. (It also handles 
'.ark' files, they're exactly the same.) This is a *very* outdated file 
format which should never be used for anything new, but unfortunately, 
you can still run into it every so often (especially if you mess about 
with old CP/M stuff). "
